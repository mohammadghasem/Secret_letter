Watson has sent a letter to Holmes in which he has written some secrets of the mysterious story.
But it is possible that the letter was tampered with in transit so that Holmes could not solve the problem.
To prevent this from happening, Watson has written a series of letters with invisible ink at the end of the letter,
in which each word in the text of the letter has been represented by a special letter of the alphabet.
Help Holmes figure out if he can trust the information inside.
